well, as always I pick a pretty common name like 'Jack'
to name a software project and it turns out that there
are thousands of projects already named this out there..

fuck it..


we'll change the name here soon

compile:
  javac *.java

run:
  java Jack

obviously we are missing 90% of the api support but
this gets us going (at least it gets me going on my
project ;) )
